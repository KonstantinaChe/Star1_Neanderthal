"This repository contains the code used to process the mitochondrial capture data done on a putatively Neanderthal sample from the Starosel'e archeological site in Crimea, Ukraine."
"The sample is composed of two sub-samples - STS1.1 and STS1.2. The difference between these two samples is a pre-treatment step applied in the DNA extraction protocol."
"Further, we have applied target enrichment using ....  and sequenced them at the VBCF".

"The intended analyses include alignment, damage pattern confirmation, consensus sequence calling, mitochondrial group definition and constructing a mitochondrial tree."
