"This repository contains the code used to process the mitochondrial capture data done on a Neanderthal sample from the Starosel'e archeological site in Crimea, Ukraine."
"The sample is composed of two sub-samples - STS1.1 and STS1.2. The difference between these two samples is a pre-treatment step applied in the DNA extraction protocol."
"Further, we have applied target enrichment using Arbor Bioscience myBaits mito expert kit and sequenced them at the VBCF".

"In workflow.slrm you can find all the processing info from adapter trimming to instructions on phylogenetic tree generation."
